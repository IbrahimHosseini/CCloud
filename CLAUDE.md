# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

CCloud is a single-module (`:app`) Android streaming client (movies / TV series) written in Kotlin with Jetpack Compose + Material 3 and Media3 ExoPlayer. It ships one APK for phones, tablets and Android TV (registered for both `LAUNCHER` and `LEANBACK_LAUNCHER`). Package / namespace: `com.pira.ccloud`. minSdk 24, target/compileSdk 36.

## Build commands

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug                 # debug APKs (ABI splits + universal)
./gradlew assembleRelease -x lint       # what CI runs; output: app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-universal-release.apk
./gradlew lint                          # uses app/lint-baseline.xml; abortOnError = false
./gradlew installDebug                  # install on the connected device/emulator
```

- Gradle wrapper is 8.11.1 (AGP 8.9.2, Kotlin 2.0.21). CI uses **JDK 17**. Gradle 8.11 cannot run on JDK 24+ (e.g. a newer Android Studio bundled JBR), so point `JAVA_HOME` at JDK 17–21 when building from the terminal, and set `ANDROID_HOME` if there is no `local.properties`.
- Release signing reads `key.properties` at the repo root (`storePassword`, `keyPassword`, `keyAlias`, `storeFile`); if the keystore file is missing the release build silently falls back to the debug signing config.
- `scripts/fix-gradle-wrapper.sh` / `verify-gradle-wrapper.sh` regenerate/verify `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar.sha256`, which CI validates.
- Releases: pushing a `v*` tag runs `.github/workflows/build-appshare.yml`, which builds and publishes `CCloud-universal.apk` to GitHub Releases. Bump `versionCode`/`versionName` in `app/build.gradle.kts`; the in-app update check (Settings) compares against the GitHub releases API for `code3-dev/CCloud`.

### Tests

There are currently **no test sources** (`app/src/test` and `app/src/androidTest` don't exist), although JUnit, Espresso and Compose UI test dependencies are declared. When adding tests: `./gradlew testDebugUnitTest --tests "com.pira.ccloud.SomeTest"` for a single JVM test, `./gradlew connectedDebugAndroidTest` for instrumented tests.

## Architecture

The README's architecture section overstates things: there is no domain layer, no LiveData/Flow, no DI, and the Leanback library is a dependency but the TV UI is pure Compose. What actually exists:

### Two activities
- `MainActivity` hosts the whole Compose app (`MainApp` → `MainScreen` → `AppNavigation`).
- `VideoPlayerActivity` is a separate, landscape, fullscreen activity. Start it only via `VideoPlayerActivity.start(context, url)` or `startWithEpisodeInfo(...)` (the episode ids are used to mark the episode as watched). It embeds a Media3 `PlayerView` with `useController = false` inside `AndroidView`, and draws its **own** Compose control overlay (seek bar, play/pause, speed, track-selection dialog). Remote-control handling is described under "Android TV remote input" below.

### Phone vs TV layout
`DeviceUtils.isTv(context)` (UiModeManager == TELEVISION) is the layout switch: TV renders `SidebarNavigation` (a `NavigationRail`) beside the content; phones render `BottomNavigationBar` in the `Scaffold`. Grid column count (`DeviceUtils.getGridColumns`) and default subtitle size also branch on it. For behaviour that depends on *how* the user navigates (remote vs touch/mouse), check `LocalInputModeManager.current.inputMode == InputMode.Keyboard` instead, as `SearchScreen` does. D-pad navigation relies on Compose's default 2D focus search over `clickable`s and Material controls; see the rules below before adding any focus code.

### Android TV remote input
- **Focus structure (the cause of most TV bugs here):**
  - Only interactive elements may be focus targets. Never put `.focusable()` on a list or on a card that holds other controls: the D-pad stops on the container and can't reach anything inside it.
  - Don't add `.focusable()` next to `clickable` or a Material button. It creates a second, nested focus target, and OK then just moves focus inward instead of clicking.
  - A button inside a `clickable` parent can't be reached with the D-pad, because focus search doesn't enter a focus target's children. Put such buttons beside the clickable area (see `FavoriteItemCard` and the playlist chips); for expandable cards make only the header clickable (see `SettingsScreen`).
  - When the focused element disappears, Android gives focus to the first element at the top left: on TV the sidebar's Movies item, or Back in the player. Opening a screen or going back is handled by `ScreenFocus` (below), but when you remove the focused element within a screen, move focus somewhere sensible yourself.
  - Don't write `onKeyEvent` handlers for OK/Enter clicks: `clickable` already handles them, and `onKeyEvent` receives both key-down and key-up, so such handlers fire twice. Custom key handling (like the settings sliders) must check `KeyEventType.KeyDown`.
- **Screen focus:** every navigation destination is wrapped in `ScreenFocus` (`components/ScreenFocus.kt`, applied in `AppNavigation`). When a screen is shown with a remote, or the user switches from touch or an air mouse to the remote, it moves focus to the `restorableFocus(key)` element that had focus last (so Back returns to the item that was opened), or else to the `initialFocus()` element. It waits until that element exists and has stayed the target for a couple of frames (content may still be loading), and gives up if the user presses a key first (`ScreenFocusHost` in `MainScreen` counts them). In a new screen, mark one `initialFocus` element for each state (a list or grid can be it: its top-left visible item gets focus), and make elements that open other screens `restorableFocus`. The initial element must be composed without scrolling, so it can't sit below the fold of a `LazyColumn` (why `SeriesDetailsContent` is a scrolling `Column`).
- **Focus visuals:** the default ripple focus highlight is too faint on a TV (on a `Card` with `Modifier.clickable` it's practically invisible). Use `Modifier.focusRing` from `components/FocusRing.kt`, placed before the element's clickable; use `focusOutline` when the focused element is a child, e.g. to outline a whole card while its header has focus.
- Compose lists can't be scrolled by dragging with a mouse or air mouse (by design; only the wheel works). With a remote they scroll by following focus.
- **Player:** `VideoPlayerActivity.dispatchKeyEvent` hands every key to the handler that `VideoPlayerScreen` registers (`onKeyHandlerChanged`), before any view sees it, so keys work even when nothing on screen has focus. With no control focused (controls hidden or shown by a tap): OK = play/pause, Left/Right = seek by `VideoPlayerSettings.seekTimeSeconds`, Up/Down = just show the controls; each of these shows the controls with focus on the seek bar, where Left/Right keep seeking and OK keeps toggling. On other controls the arrows move focus and OK clicks. Back is left to the default handling (closes the player). Whenever the remote becomes the input (at start, or after a mouse or touch), focus also moves to the seek bar, and when the retry state swaps the seek bar out, focus moves to play/pause. Otherwise Android's default focus lands on the Back button and OK closes the player.
- When a key handler consumes a key-down, it must also consume the matching key-up: in Compose foundation 1.7, `clickable` fires `onClick` on **any** OK/Enter key-up, so a stray key-up clicks whichever control just received focus (the player tracks this in `consumedKeys`).
- **Text fields:** a Compose `TextField` opens the keyboard as soon as it gains focus. Never wrap it in `.clickable {}`: that adds a separate outer focus target that captures D-pad focus, so the field (and its keyboard) never gets focus. Compose's own D-pad handling inside text fields ignores remotes that don't report themselves as D-pad devices (common on cheap Android TV boxes, e.g. OK sends `KEYCODE_ENTER`); `SearchScreen.handleRemoteKey` covers them.

### Testing on an Android TV emulator
- `uiautomator dump` fails while the UI is animating and leaves the previous dump in place, so delete the old file and retry until a new one is written.
- `adb shell input keyevent` injects from a *virtual* device, which Compose's text-field D-pad handling (and `handleRemoteKey`) ignore. To behave like a real remote, register one with `adb shell uinput -` (JSON "register"/"inject" commands; `KEY_SELECT` maps to DPAD_CENTER, `KEY_ENTER` to ENTER).
- The Google TV image needs ≥4 GB emulator RAM; at 2 GB the keyboard (Gboard) stalls for seconds and Back presses fall through to the app.
- If the emulator stops resolving hosts (screens show "Unable to resolve host"), restart it with `-dns-server 8.8.8.8`.
- The content CDN (`*.dl150m.info`) may be unreachable outside Iran, so real titles can fail to play. `VideoPlayerActivity` is not exported; to try the player with a public test stream, export it in a scratch copy of the project, never in the repo.

### Navigation
String routes are defined in the `AppScreens` sealed class (`splash` is the start destination and navigates to `movies`; detail routes are `single_movie/{movieId}`, `single_series/{seriesId}`, `country/{countryId}`). `MainScreen` maps the current route back to an `AppScreens` by prefix to decide whether the bottom bar is shown. The Movies/Series/Search/Country ViewModels are created once in `AppNavigation` (activity-scoped) so their state survives tab switches — don't create them per-destination.

### Passing items to detail screens
Detail screens do **not** receive objects via nav arguments. The list/search screens first call `StorageUtils.saveMovieToFile` / `saveSeriesToFile` (which deletes previously cached items and writes `filesDir/movie_<id>.json` / `series_<id>.json`), then navigate with only the id; `SingleMovieScreen`/`SingleSeriesScreen` read it back with `loadMovieFromFile`/`loadSeriesFromFile`. Navigating to a detail route without saving first shows "not found".

### Data layer
- Repositories in `data/repository` extend `BaseRepository`, which owns the shared `OkHttpClient`, the API key, and `executeRequest(primaryUrl, requestBuilder)`: on failure it retries the same path against each host in `helperServers`. Always go through `executeRequest` so the fallback hosts work.
- Endpoints are `https://server-hi-speed-iran.info/api/...` with the API key as a path segment. Responses are parsed by hand with `org.json` (`optString`/`optInt` with defaults, skipping malformed items), not kotlinx.serialization.
- ViewModels expose Compose `mutableStateOf` properties with `private set` and launch work in `viewModelScope`. Results are filtered through `LanguageUtils.shouldDisplayTitle` to hide items with Farsi titles.

### Persistence
- `StorageUtils` (a singleton object) stores everything as kotlinx.serialization JSON files in `filesDir`: favorites and favorite groups, watched episodes, subtitle / video-player / font settings, and the cached detail items above. Classes in `data/model` are `@Serializable` and are kept by ProGuard (`-keep class com.pira.ccloud.data.model.**`); renaming their fields breaks data already stored on users' devices.
- Theme settings are the exception: `ThemeManager` uses SharedPreferences (`theme_prefs`).
- Settings changes flow through callbacks, not shared state: `MainApp` holds theme/font state and passes `onThemeSettingsChanged`/`onFontSettingsChanged` down through `AppNavigation` to `SettingsScreen`. `VideoPlayerActivity` reads settings from `StorageUtils` directly when it starts.

### Fonts
The optional Vazirmatn font exists twice: `res/font` (used by `FontManager` for Compose text) and `assets/font` (used by the player via `Typeface.createFromAsset` for subtitle styling). Keep both in sync.
